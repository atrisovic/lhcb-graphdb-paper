\section {Conclusion}


In this paper we presented the LHCb graph database, a novel approach for recording dependencies between the software and data. The data nodes in the graph represent each production of experimental or simulated data, while the software nodes represent each project within LHCb, how it depends on other projects (modules) and how it is linked to the data production. Furthermore, we introduced a methodology to recreate a data set independently of the CERN computing infrastructure using the information stored in the \emph{Production} nodes. We are concentrating our efforts to advance this methodology to make the LHCb data replicable, reusable and sustainable for the long-term preservation.
