\begin{abstract}

In recent years awareness of the importance of preserving the experimental data and scientific software at CERN has been rising. To support this effort, we are presenting a novel approach to structure dependencies of the LHCb data and software to make it more accessible in the long-term future. In this paper, we detail the implementation of a graph database of these dependencies. We list the implications that can be deduced from the graph mining (such as a search for the legacy software), with emphasis on data preservation. Furthermore, we introduce a methodology of recreating the LHCb data, thus supporting reproducible research and data stewardship. Finally, we describe how this information is made available to the users on a web portal that promotes data and analysis preservation and good practise with analysis documentation.
